# .files

My dotfiles for macOS and Linux.

To symlink all config files tracked by git in this repository into your `$HOME`
and `$HOME/.config/`, simply use

```sh
make
```

Original config files, if existed, will have `.orig` appended to their names.

For all available Make targets, see

```sh
make help
```

Both iTerm2 and vim use the [monkai-tasty
theme](https://github.com/patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty) ðŸŽ‰.

Approach inspired by [webpro/dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) and
[jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles). Other credits are
listed in each file ðŸ––.
